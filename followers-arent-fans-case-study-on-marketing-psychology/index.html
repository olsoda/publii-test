Let me be clear, I don't think she's a terrible influencer or failure or anything – I just think it's an example of how Marketing actually works. Let's analyze some of the principles of marketing psychology.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="funnels">Funnels</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Marketing is not a one-and-done activity. Effective marketing has different stages – and you'll lose some people between each stage. Here are three funnels to illustrate 1) the psychology of how sales happen, 2) the different stages of a sale, and 3) how not all fans and followers are the same.</p><p></p><p></p><h3 id="marketing-psychology-funnel-1-aida">Marketing Psychology Funnel #1: AIDA:</h3><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figure class="wp-image-32641"><img loading="lazy" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/aida2.jpg" alt="marketing psychology funnel: AIDA" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-xs.jpg 300w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-sm.jpg 480w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-md.jpg 768w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/aida2-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Every customer goes through a process before becoming a customer. Before anyone takes action, they must have a desire to do the action. Before having any desire to do so they have to have some level of interest. Before interest, they have to even be aware of the fact you exist.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Social media is mostly about generating awareness (and even then your reach is limited unless you pay for promotion) and the initial stages of interest, but it's also a terrible platform for moving people down the funnel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People seem to think awareness will magically lead to sales. Even if you rationally understand that you have to nurture first, I still people expect to post about something and have everyone rush out to buy/signup/listen.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That's not the case. You have to have specific stages people go through in your sales funnel...</p><p></p><p></p><h3 id="marketing-psychology-funnel-2-tofu-mofu-bofu">Marketing Psychology Funnel #2: TOFU, MOFU, BOFU</h3><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figure class="wp-image-32643"><img loading="lazy" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/funnels.jpg" alt="marketing psychology funnel: TOFU, MOFU, BOFU" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-xs.jpg 300w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-sm.jpg 480w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-md.jpg 768w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-lg.jpg 1024w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-xl.jpg 1360w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/funnels-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Top of Funnel</strong> is all about creating awareness. You do this through people finding your song on playlists, your social posts, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Middle of Funnel:</strong> is all about nurturing people. Some people will never get to this phase but it's ok. Build a deeper connection with your brand, encourage them to be more invested.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Bottom of Funnel:</strong> is all about getting people to take action – sales of merch, buying tickets, joining your Patreon, etc. Once again, not everyone will get here, but that's ok.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the case of this Instagram influencer that struggled to sell shirts, she probably had a very leaky funnel between the TOFU and MOFU stages. She was creating lots of superficial content that attracted people, but they never got nurtured beyond that.</p><p></p><p></p><h3 id="marketing-psychology-funnel-3-david-s-heierarchy-of-leads">Marketing Psychology Funnel #3: David's Heierarchy of Leads</h3><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figure class="wp-image-32614"><img loading="lazy" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/leads.023.jpeg" alt="marketing psychology funnel: David's Hierarchy of Leads" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-xs.jpeg 300w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-sm.jpeg 480w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-md.jpeg 768w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-lg.jpeg 1024w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-xl.jpeg 1360w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/53/responsive/leads.023-2xl.jpeg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p id="block-38384b53-b569-4b89-b7d6-40b5a553db39">It’s a mistake to think that all fans are the same.

It’s way more profitable to give superfans premium content/attention/experiences than to try to get the masses to do something.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-dd28c4bf-6969-4874-86ec-2316e8992c7c">I’ve come up with a framework to think about the levels of fandom called David’s Hierarchy of Leads:</p><p></p><p></p><ol id="block-39470623-1df7-4d63-becc-e1b48fdcf819"><li>Non-Fans</li><li>Casual Fans</li><li>True Fans</li><li>Superfans</li></ol><p></p><p></p><p id="block-a6440936-ddf0-46c7-9506-f65aac6493b5"><strong>Non-Fans</strong>&nbsp;are self-explanatory. They either don’t know about you or don’t like you. Your goal is to get people’s attention with your music, YouTube content, etc so that they become Casual Fans.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-a234aae9-9329-4ebf-9c40-c109372079e0"><strong>Casual Fans</strong>&nbsp;are people who like you but aren’t actively invested. Maybe they’ve saved a couple of your songs. Maybe if their friends are coming to your show they’ll tag along, but really they don’t&nbsp;<em>care</em>&nbsp;beyond the surface level. At this level, you’ll get a few pennies from their streams, but it’s foolish to spend your time and money to MONETIZE them at this point. Your goal should be nurturing them into True Fans via special content, talking to them after gigs, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-b8537140-35f6-4fea-9056-53ee1b1e233a"><strong>True Fans</strong>&nbsp;are the people that actively care about you. They will come to shows, buy merch, donate to your crowdfunding or Patreon. They want to see you succeed and will step up when there is an ask from you. But if you do your job well, they can graduate to Superfans.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-017a1bb7-cc32-4af2-9240-99420e053831"><strong>Superfans</strong>&nbsp;are the truest of the True Fans. They will do ANYTHING for you. They will drive states away to see you. They’ll donate $5000 to fund your next album. If they’re well off, introduce you to their business network and help you get cool opportunities. They’ll go to your fundraiser parties where there’s no point other than to hang with other cool fans that care about you because they freakin’ love you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the case of this influencer, she had TONS of casual fans, but not True Fans or Superfans. In ADIA terms, casual fans will rarely get past the awareness or interest phase. Casual fans will probably never get to the middle of your funnel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to learn more about a band that CRUSHES it with True Fans and Superfans, <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/how-this-band-got-double-their-album-crowdfunding-goal-from-35k-to-65k/" data-type="post" data-id="30692">check out this article about The Talbott Brothers.</a></p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="why-you-need-more-than-social-media-to-nurture">Why You Need More Than Social Media to Nurture</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Just posting *more* on social media doesn't automatically mean you're building relationships with your fans or getting them closer to buying. Yes, it's a key piece of the puzzle (which will look different for everyone). But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKnl8Qe_JoM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is why people build email lists</a> – so they can have the fans who are the most committed in one place and tailor messages to them!</p><p></p><p></p><p>The main point I'm getting at is that think strategically about what each element of your marketing strategy is for. Remember that not everyone is the same – and it takes time to get someone to be in a place where they are ready to buy/convert!</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/davids-hierarchy-of-leads-the-4-levels-of-fandom/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> David&#x27;s Hierarchy of Leads (The 4 Levels of Fandom)</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/guide-how-to-build-a-pro-website-and-email-for-musicians-that-gets-results-in-2023/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> GUIDE: How to Build A Pro Website and Email for Musicians That Gets RESULTS in 2023 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-11-29T00:02" class="feed__date">November 29, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/should-your-band-start-a-patreon-in-2023-case-study/">Should Your Band Start A Patreon in 2023 (Case Study)</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
