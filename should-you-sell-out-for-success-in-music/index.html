But you know what makes them work for me? Because they're still being 100% artistically authentic&nbsp; – with both of these ladies, they were saying what they wanted to say, making music they wanted to make. It's 100% true to their influences.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>You Are Unique</h2><p></p><p></p><p>I know it sounds cliche, but there really is nobody like you musically. Nobody in the world has your set of interests and creative influences. If you try to mimic someone else (or whatever flavor of the month seems to be "working"), it will come across as just that – a poor imitation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People listen to music to feel something. How can they feel something if YOU don't feel what you're singing/playing/writing? Your goal is to figure out what you feel and figure out how to package it so someone else can connect with that same emotion.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Meet Mat Kearney – An Authentic Artist</h2><p></p><p></p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.matkearney.com/" target="_blank">Mat Kearney</a> is an AWESOME artist. I had the privilege of interviewing him on an episode of our podcast, <a href="/podcast">Music Business Mindset</a>. One of the things he credits his success to is that he was not afraid to bend genres when starting his career.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mat grew up listening to both Paul Simon and Hip-Hop. When he started writing songs in the mid-2000s, he wasn't concerned with the distinct genres of the day. He would write a singer-songwriter song with a spoken-word breakdown and not care. That's what he wanted to make. It was authentically him. People with similar musical interests heard it and it connected with them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Since then, Mat has experimented even more with genre, evolving his style over time and collaborating with people outside his niche – all while still being authentic with his creativity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Listen to my interview with him on Music Business Mindset (formerly known as Behind The Band):</p><p></p><p></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/11-mat-kearney-on-artistry-songwriting-and-being-true/id1499427688?i=1000540785100"></iframe></div><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/distrokid-vs-cd-baby-2023-one-is-better-for-most/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> DistroKid vs CD Baby 2023 (One is Better For Most)</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/how-to-prepare-your-band-for-the-studio/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How To Prepare Your Band For The Studio </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-06T18:07" class="feed__date">April 6, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-you-should-be-playing-shows-even-if-you-dont-have-a-band-yet/">Why You Should Be Playing Shows Even if You Don&#x27;t Have a Band Yet</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-05T20:44" class="feed__date">April 5, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-you-should-never-pay-tiktok-influencers-for-song-tags/">Why You Should NEVER Pay TikTok Influencers for Song Tags</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-09T21:49" class="feed__date">April 9, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/successful-artists-make-their-own-opportunities/">Successful Artists Make Their Own Opportunities</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
