Told you're shooting yourself in the foot by not posting everyday? Pulling your hair out because you have no idea what to post? That's ok. You don't need to do that for a successful career.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here' the thing: if you have to force yourself to post on a consistent basis, you'll never reach the momentum on that platform as the people who LIVE on those platforms. You'll get drowned out and not build up a following, engagement, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So don't stress about it. Post when you have something to share – when the genuine excitement can shine through. But otherwise, being lukewarm about Instagram or TikTok will just lead to you being a worse version of the heavy users.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It doesn't matter if Instagram or TikTok are "THE platforms right now" and "you have to be on them." If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. But you DO need to find something that DOES work for you. I've seen another option become viable: microcommunities.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Subreddits, Discord servers, Facebook groups, IRL clubs, etc – related to music OR NOT. These are places where you can BELONG and actually connect with people. Don't try to ~promote~ yourself on them – just be a real person. Find your tribe and make things happen (<a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/podcast/17-bad-bad-hats-creating-your-own-opportunities/" data-type="podcast" data-id="32463">like how Bad Bad Hats planned their own shows</a>). If there's a place and time to share – do it. Just don't be spammy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/music-marketing-psychology/" data-type="post" data-id="32638">You don't need followers – you need friends and fans</a>. The thing with small communities is that you'll naturally make friends. These people are WAY more likely to <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/davids-hierarchy-of-leads/" data-type="post" data-id="32613">become true fans and superfans</a>.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-you-should-be-playing-shows-even-if-you-dont-have-a-band-yet/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Why You Should Be Playing Shows Even if You Don&#x27;t Have a Band Yet</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/cory-wong-is-a-genius-at-content-creation/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Cory Wong is a Genius at Content Creation </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-12-18T16:34" class="feed__date">December 18, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/top-4-reasons-for-releasing-singles-over-albums-as-a-new-artist/">Top 4 Reasons for Releasing Singles Over Albums as a New Artist</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-03-29T22:22" class="feed__date">March 29, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/brand-building-vs-activation-on-social-media-for-musicians/">BRAND BUILDING vs ACTIVATION on Social Media for Musicians</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
