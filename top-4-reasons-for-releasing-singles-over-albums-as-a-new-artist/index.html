Here's why:</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Consistency is King:</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Being able to have something *new* on a consistent basis is huge in the social media age. It's the same reason why every YouTuber, brand, etc is posting on a schedule – daily, weekly, every 3 days, whatever. You now get to have new content and things to talk about on a regular basis.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Additionally, your <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/davids-hierarchy-of-leads/" data-type="post" data-id="32613">true fans and super fans</a> will learn that they can expect new music each month/two months/whatever, which helps people <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/music-marketing-psychology/" data-type="post" data-id="32638">get invested and stay invested in what you're doing.</a></p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. The Call to Action for a Single is Way Stronger than an Album</h2><p></p><p></p><p>A Call to Action is simply marketing speak for the one specific thing you're asking the audience to do. The simpler the better. The easier for them to commit to, the better. Until you have the star power of Taylor Swift, it's always going to be easier and more clear to ask people to listen to a song than an entire album.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People are lazy. Asking someone to listen to an album is a COMMITMENT (kinda like how it's easier to watch 3 episodes of a show back to back than watch a movie). You want to ease the friction as much as possible.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Money/Investment</h2><p></p><p></p><p>It costs money to produce music and promote it. Instead of half-assing an entire album, put that same amount of money into one or two songs at a time so you can <a href="/.">hire a great production team and/or mix engineer</a> and actually devote time and money into the promotion process (maybe via <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/youtube-ads-for-promoting-music-videos-initial-thoughts/" data-type="post" data-id="35110">ads</a>), hiring a promoter, get cooler brand-wide graphics, shooting a video, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Improve Your Process</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Every release is a learning experience. I still learn something new every release with the artists I manage. Plus, what works for another artist won't necessarily work for you – you need to figure out what works for your audience/genre/brand. Doing one song at a time lets you iterate and learn.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/what-makes-a-good-song-its-not-originality/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What Makes a Good Song?
