So let's set the record straight.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>What is a Song?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>First we need to talk about what a SONG is. <strong>At its core, a song is a collection of lyrics, melody, and message</strong>. Dress up a song however you want (or do it completely acapella) and it’s still that SONG.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>So What is Production?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>As a discipline, <strong>production is everything we do to bring out the best of the song so that people want to listen again.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>That’s not to say that the production is the star of the show. Far from it. A good production will cause people to *get* the core of the song and more readily form an emotional connection to it. <strong>A good production is measured with the number of goosebumps the listener gets</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Someone once told me something that stuck with me: getting someone to listen to your song is the easy part. Getting someone to listen AGAIN is the hard part -- and that's why production is important. A song and it's message will connect with the head and heart, but PRODUCTION is about getting it to connect with the listener's BODY and soul.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Production isn’t Just Engineering</h2><p></p><p></p><p>People seem to conflate production and engineering. It’s true that engineering is a key part of production, but it’s only one piece of the puzzle. <strong>You could have the most pristine recording of all time that doesn’t give goosebumps.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Production is also concerned with <strong>arrangement, structure, tone, performance</strong>, etc. Production is about how to put all these things together in a goosebump-giving way. In fact, engineering might be the lowest priority of all production-related activities. <strong>A song’s arrangement, performance, and overall sonic mood are vastly more important than it being pristinely recorded.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>All decisions of the production process should be in service to the core song’s message and emotion.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How Does One Master Production?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Fantastic question. I don’t think many people have truly mastered production. I certainly haven’t gotten anywhere close. Anyone who claims to have is full of crap (although there ARE people who are undeniably brilliant at production).</p><p></p><p></p><p>There’s a lot nobody understands about music – and that’s what makes it so great. I can give you an overview of what makes a song or production great, but you also have to train your intuition to start being able to understand the stuff that’s less explainable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It’s similar to how you can summarize how a car works with “there’s an explosion that pushes a piston down a cylinder, and that force starts turning various gears and shafts until it reaches the wheels” – but to fully understand WHY it works would require a complete understanding of quantum physics!</p><p></p><p></p><p>We can talk about tips and principles that I’ve found to work, but it’s also something you have to spend a lifetime pursuing. You have to be endlessly curious about why listening to a song makes you feel a certain way. Do this to build up your instincts, then trust them.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/touring-is-still-one-of-the-best-ways-to-build-a-career/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Touring is Still One of the Best Ways to Build a Career</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/how-much-does-a-mix-engineer-cost/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How Much Does A Mix Engineer Cost? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-10-03T22:42" class="feed__date">October 3, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-systems-are-vital-for-musician-mental-health-with-chris-graham/">Why Systems are Vital for Musician Mental Health (with Chris Graham)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-11T14:18" class="feed__date">April 11, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/theres-more-than-one-way-to-skin-the-musical-cat/">There&#x27;s More Than One Way To Skin The Musical Cat</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-09T21:56" class="feed__date">April 9, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/its-ok-to-figure-out-the-music-business-as-you-go/">It&#x27;s Ok To Figure Out The Music Business As You Go</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
