They either don't know about you or don't like you. Your goal is to get people's attention with your music, YouTube content, etc so that they become Casual Fans.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-a234aae9-9329-4ebf-9c40-c109372079e0"><strong>Casual Fans</strong> are people who like you but aren't actively invested. Maybe they've saved a couple of your songs. Maybe if their friends are coming to your show they'll tag along, but really they don't <em>care</em> beyond the surface level. At this level, you'll get a few pennies from their streams, but it's foolish to spend your time and money to MONETIZE them at this point. Your goal should be nurturing them into True Fans via special content, talking to them after gigs, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-b8537140-35f6-4fea-9056-53ee1b1e233a"><strong>True Fans</strong> are the people that actively care about you. They will come to shows, buy merch, donate to your crowdfunding or Patreon. They want to see you succeed and will step up when there is an ask from you. But if you do your job well, they can graduate to Superfans.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-017a1bb7-cc32-4af2-9240-99420e053831"><strong>Superfans</strong> are the truest of the True Fans. They will do ANYTHING for you. They will drive states away to see you. They'll donate $5000 to fund your next album. If they're well off, introduce you to their business network and help you get cool opportunities. They'll go to your fundraiser parties where there's no point other than to hang with other cool fans that care about you because they freakin' love you.</p><p></p><p></p><p id="block-b3e8206a-5fc1-4eac-a3e6-d5f9361aecb4">This isn't magical thinking. I developed this framework after spending a number of years on the road with <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/how-this-band-got-double-their-album-crowdfunding-goal-from-35k-to-65k/">The Talbott Brothers</a> and witnessing this phenomenon firsthand. It freakin works. For instance, their last Indiegogo for an album, <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/how-this-band-got-double-their-album-crowdfunding-goal-from-35k-to-65k/">they asked for $35,000 but ended up with $60,000.</a> This is 100% because they understand it's way more viable long-term to nurture fans into more serious fans rather than just chasing fame.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/refund-policy/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Refund Policy</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/followers-arent-fans-case-study-on-marketing-psychology/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Followers Aren&#x27;t Fans: Case Study on Marketing Psychology </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
