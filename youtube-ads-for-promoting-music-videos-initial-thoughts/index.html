So it was a perfect chance to test YouTube ads – something I've been wanting to try for a while.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Obviously this is important because YouTube is one of the biggest music platforms in the world. In <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/music-industry-changes/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/music-industry-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 they say that over 2 BILLION people watched music content on YouTube</a> – which is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4x the total number of Spotify users</a>. It's also the <a href="https://www.semrush.com/website/top/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.semrush.com/website/top/" rel="noreferrer noopener">2nd most visited website in the world</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Anyway, I don't think I need to explain more about <em>why</em> YouTube is important, so lets move on to what we did in this instance to start rebuilding a YouTube presence.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It made sense that if we want to get more views on YouTube, we should be promoting to users <em>already</em> on YouTube (although I did try some Meta/FB/IG ads at the same time, but quickly nixed it – more on that later)! Getting people to switch which platform/site they are on is HARD; plus users have deeply ingrained consumption/usage habits so IG users don't necessarily mean they are solid YouTube users and vice-versa.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I decided to promote two videos on the new channel: the new music video for Here to Stay, and an older music video for a cover of the Elevation Worship song My Testimony. All the ads were displayed in the "suggestion" area (NOT the ads before/after videos).</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figure class="wp-image-35111"><img loading="lazy" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/YT-ad-example.jpg" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-xs.jpg 300w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-sm.jpg 480w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-md.jpg 768w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-lg.jpg 1024w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-xl.jpg 1360w, https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/media/posts/68/responsive/YT-ad-example-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>I set up both to have a budget of $20/day.

Compare this to my initial run of Meta ads where it was closer to $1/click.</li><li>The total budget required to get results is MUCH lower than on Meta. When I experimented with Meta for this and in the past, it seems like it required a larger up-front investment to start getting results (like a couple of weeks at $10-20 a day).</li><li>While I said on average $20/day, it really front-loaded the spend. It did like $60 in the first 24 hours. I'm ok with this since I want to see results right away (which I did)! If you're new to paid ads, remember that these daily budgets are averaged out over weeks.</li><li>The quality of the views was higher than I was expecting for Here to Stay, but lower than expected for My Testimony.<ul><li>On Here to Stay, even with 80% of views coming from the ad campaign, we still had roughly 50% of viewers still watching by the 0:30 mark – in line with most other videos I have analytics for. Also got 52 likes (98% up) which is more than</li><li>My Testimony had a lot of people peace out by 0:36. Which miiiight make sense since a lot of people might have clicked on it because recognize the song, but leave after it wasn't what they were expecting.</li></ul></li><li>Even though it only netted us 44 subscribers (<a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/focus-on-growing-fans-not-your-stream-numbers/" data-type="post" data-id="29997">a more important metric in the long run</a>), it still achieved the shorter-term goal of getting some credibility on a brand-new account. I imagine if this was done with a more established/subscribed account it would do more to "tip" the algorithm in our favor than with a brand new account.</li><li>I wish Google would let me target by genre or more granular interest. If I could specifically target worship music lovers or people who like Hillsong Young and Free, etc that would have been MUCH more powerful IMO. For now, "Music Lovers" seems to be the target that got the most traction according to the campaign reporting.</li><li>Did I mention that it makes sense that targeting YouTube viewers to watch your YouTube video makes more sense than asking them to switch what they're doing? :)</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>I will definitely plan on doing more YouTube ads in the future since the CPV seems good and I learned a lot – even with a relatively low spend. I can definitely see the power in making sure that ads have their own line in the budget from now on – rather than just decided to throw $100 at it for fun like I did here.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're interested in setting up YouTube ads for your band, we'd be happy to talk with you about setting that up! <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="30663">Just hit us up at the contact form!</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/home/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Home</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/single-production/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Single Production </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-10-03T22:42" class="feed__date">October 3, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-systems-are-vital-for-musician-mental-health-with-chris-graham/">Why Systems are Vital for Musician Mental Health (with Chris Graham)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-11T14:18" class="feed__date">April 11, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/theres-more-than-one-way-to-skin-the-musical-cat/">There&#x27;s More Than One Way To Skin The Musical Cat</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-09T21:56" class="feed__date">April 9, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/its-ok-to-figure-out-the-music-business-as-you-go/">It&#x27;s Ok To Figure Out The Music Business As You Go</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
