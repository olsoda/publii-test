As I threw out ideas, he pushed back at a few of them. This is normal (and healthy) in a writing session, but his reasoning was interesting to me: he thought it was too <em>predictable.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p>Specifically, I don't think he liked the chords I was suggesting for the melody we were working with. "It sounds too obvious that it would go to the four chord there," he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Well yeah that's where the melody is leading," I said, "trying to force a different chord there would just make it sound awkward and pull the listener out of the flow."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I guess I just want to be more original than that" he said. Which I totally understand and can sympathize with.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now, I don't bring this up as a way to stroke my ego and use my platform to make the case that I was right and he was wrong – he might have been right after all. But it got me thinking, <strong>a lot of musicians are probably too worried about being <em>original</em> and it hinders songwriting/creative output.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Originality is Overrated</h2><p></p><p></p><p>When I was in college, I took a class on advertising. We had to read a book by one of the GOATs of adverting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ogilvy_(businessman)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ogilvy_(businessman)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Ogilvy</a>. I don't remember much from the class aside from one main he made in the book <em>Ogilvy on Advertising</em>. He basically said (and I'm paraphrasing), "Oh you think creativity means originality? I think originality is one of most dangerous words in advertising – it causes people to peruse things that don't matter. To me, if it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Heck yeah, the point of advertising is to SELL, not be original! If it doesn't sell, then it doesn't matter! The same thing applies to music: the point is to get the listener to feel something! To get the song stuck in their head, to get them want to play it over and over again!</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Steal Like an Artist</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The over-obsession of originality in creative fields is echoed in a book I think all creatives should read, <a aria-label="Steal Like an Artist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://evergreenrecords.com//links/steal-like-an-artist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steal Like an Artist</a>. The main points of the book are:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><p></p><li>There is nothing new under the sun</li><p></p><p></p><li>You are the sum of your influences</li><p></p><p></p><li>True creativity comes from acknowledging and embracing those two previous points</li><p></p><p></p><li>You will be unique because nobody else has the same influences and life experiences as you</li><p></p></ul><p></p><p></p><p>That's not to say copy and rip off (because cheap imitations never connect with people), but be yourself while being true to who your roots/influences.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The ONLY thing that matters is that the listener gets transported into another world when listening</strong>. Does it hold the listener in a flow state? Does it make you forget about the world for a brief moment? Does it make you want to dance and sing? Do you get goosebumps? Etc.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbW3sES2zCw</div></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Even Taylor Swift, one of the greatest songwriters of our generation, uses typical "pop" chord progressions over and over. She doesn't care. She's just trying to write a great song with a great melody and on a relatable topic.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But are the songs cliché? If you're a Taylor hater, you might say so, but I don't think so. Taylor songs are a masterclass in embracing the pop tradition without slipping into the pitfalls of being generic/derivative dribble that causes people to NOT connect with a song. The fact is that Taylor's songs WORK – they get stuck in your head and rack up millions of streams for good reason!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sure you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lampoon pop chord progressions</a> all you want– but the fact is, <strong>a good song is a good song.</strong></p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/always-add-a-spotify-canvas-to-your-songs/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> ALWAYS Add a Spotify Canvas to Your Songs</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/top-4-reasons-for-releasing-singles-over-albums-as-a-new-artist/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Top 4 Reasons for Releasing Singles Over Albums as a New Artist </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-01-04T12:23" class="feed__date">January 4, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/what-is-a-radio-remix/">What is a Radio Remix?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-12-28T18:05" class="feed__date">December 28, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/what-is-music-production/">What is Music Production?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-12-05T22:17" class="feed__date">December 5, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/stems-vs-multitracks-whats-the-difference/">Stems vs Multitracks (What&#x27;s The Difference?)</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
