                <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So I've been using the <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/links/astonorigin">Aston Origin</a> plus their <a aria-label="combo shockmount and pop filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://evergreenrecords.com//links/aston-shock-mount-pop-filter" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noreferrer noopener">combo shockmount and pop filter</a> to record vocals on a lot of projects lately. I gotta say, it sounds AWESOME. There's probably not a better bang for your buck out there.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the fact that the mic only costs $199 – this guy regularly sounds better than some of my mics that cost three times as much – including my U87 clone, etc. With just about everyone I've tried it on, it sounds great. In fact it sounds amazing even just through a <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/links/2i2">Focusrite Scarlett</a> (in fact, that's literally the chain we used for <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/releases/universal-hearts-ep-anthem-worship/" data-type="releases" data-id="34441">the first Anthem Worship EP</a>)</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Seriously – if you need a vocal mic, just get it plus the <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/links/astonmount">shockmount and pop filter.</a> If you're in an untreated room, I'd suggest getting the <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/links/halo">Aston Halo</a> too.</p>

<p>Assorted Thoughts:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>You probably want the shockmount and pop filter. Reduces vibrations, and gives better plosive reduction than the minimal "built in" pop filter.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The thing LOOKS amazing. I love the round tube look. The mesh waveguide thing around the capsule is so distinct too.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>It may not be the mic you'd want to use in EVERY case, but most singers will sound at least good on it. As opposed to my 87 clone which some people sounded TERRIBLE on.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The built-in highpass filter feels like it's a little high for some voices. I usually leave it off (flat) in the studio.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>It's cool that there's an option to direct mount it without the shock mount (and I gather they've done some stuff to reduce direct-mounted vibration), but I wouldn't mount it like that to be safe, but more importantly, the shock mount lets you position it more easily, while there's no adjustment at all when directly mounted.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Having the pop filter directly attached to the shock mount makes it stay in a consistent spot which is nice. A gooseneck pop filter will get bumped, moved around, pushed too close to the mic by the singer, etc.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>It's so irrationally satisfying to have a mic, shock mount, and pop filter all from the same lineup.</li>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>

<p>I often hear people talk about how they recently learned mixing from YouTube or following social accounts with mixing tips. Or that learning mixing is "easy" these days with the wealth of knowledge available online. At risk of sounding like a grumpy old man, nothing makes my eyes roll more than those two statements.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that the internet has brought about a ton of free exchange of information. But setting aside the amount of misinformation out there from "content creators" that have little qualification to teach the subject, I don't think it's something that you can learn from watching a ton of content on the subject over a few weeks or months or even a few <em>years</em>.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Music is an inherently emotional thing. So is mixing. Yes, it's also technical, but every technical action is about bringing about emotion for the listener. Sure videos can teach you some techniques (some more questionable than others when you're listening to just anybody with a webcam), but what they CAN'T teach you is how to listen to your body.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Obviously if you're a musician, you inherently understand that something needs to feel right. You probably have personal opinions on tones, balance, etc – which is great! Knowing what you want to hear is one of the first steps of mixing. But in order to EXECUTE that takes thousands upon thousands of hours practice. It requires knowing how to listen to your body and how to make that happen. Knowing what CAN and CAN'T be done with the track. Knowing what's working and what's not. Knowing when you've gotten too fixated on a particular sound and need to step back and examine the bigger picture. Knowing when you've started doing what you want to hear for ego's sake rather than serving the song. That's connection between your gut and the real world is something you have to develop through trial and error.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I do watch videos of how the greats work – but the key is that I'm wanting to learn from <em>the greats.</em> People who's work I love and respect. But even then, I'm not watching for "cheats" or "secret hacks," but rather what's going on in their mind, what their flow looks like, what their philosophy is, etc. Then not be afraid to do the exact opposite of what they do. What works for someone else might not work for you.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the end of the day, you have to trust your gut with <em>everything</em> related to music. Don't just listen to the speakers, but also listen to your body. No amount of "3 steps to perfect bottom end" videos or whatever will train your intuition and your ability to translate that into the real world. Within ANY musical discipline, until you can create with guts, confidence, and heart, your work won't be able to connect with others on that deep, emotional level either.</p>

<p>The creator economy is<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/07/18/make-the-most-of-the-creator-economy/?sh=1e9ee83316e9" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/07/18/make-the-most-of-the-creator-economy/?sh=1e9ee83316e9" rel="noreferrer noopener"> huge and growing</a>. We all know this. In fact, <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/davids-hierarchy-of-leads/" data-type="post" data-id="32613">I encourage musicians to consider a business model inspired by creators of all formats – one based around monetizing your top fans</a>. We've seen platforms like <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://memberful.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://memberful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memberful</a> (which is owned by Patreon), <a href="https://kajabi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kajabi</a>, and a certain platform that rhymes with "<em>lonely plans</em>"  grow into huge parts of the creator economy.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So I think it's inevitable that Spotify and Apple Music will release their own versions of those creator tools for musicians directly integrated into their platforms – and it's surprising that it hasn't happened already. It's not a matter of <em>if,</em> but <em>when.</em></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>The Benefit For the Platforms</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Businesses like Spotify and Apple exist to make money. They are always going to be on the lookout for how to make MORE money. Patreon makes money by taking a cut of all transactions (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing">currently between 5%-12%</a>). That's money Patreon and similar platforms are making that Spotify and Apple currently NOT making, but easily could. Apple would probably charge between 15%-30% of revenue judging by their App Store fees. That would add up quickly for them.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Adding these features to their Spotify for Artists and Apple Music for Artists offerings is extremely low-hanging-fruit. Every artist has their "for artists" account on the platforms already, so it would be very easy to get artists to try it out.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It would also benefit those services as an attempt to lock-in users. For end users, makes it harder to switch to a different streaming service if you're already invested in that ecosystem. Switching from Spotify to Apple Music or vice-versa is no longer just "which app do I open for music" but a now platform you've built up memberships, content, etc. Similar to how Apple has tried to get you using iCloud for notes, storage, photos, etc – switching phones is also switching ecosystems, and that's a <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It also allows for differentiation between platforms. Imagine if Taylor Swift inked a deal with Apple to have their platform be the exclusive home of her membership content. All the Swifties would basically HAVE to switch to Apple Music if they want to get the superfan content.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Imagine the PR headlines: <em>"Apple has paid out over X million dollars directly to independent creators in 2024,"</em> and blurbs/PR videos going on about how they're <em>"empowering creators to build sustainable careers" </em> in the same way they wax eloquently about how the App Store has let people build businesses in the app economy at all their developer event.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Precedent: Podcasting</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We've seen a trend where platforms have been adding more monetization tools directly in their platforms.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's been clear that Apple has been pivoting to services for revenue growth over the past decade</a>, so adding memberships would be very in-character for them. In fact there's precedent for this exact thing! <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions/">In 2021, they added memberships/subscriptions for podcast creators</a>! They obviously see the value in getting in on the creator economy and have built the framework to do so that could probably be ported over to the music platform fairly easily.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/paidsubscriptions" data-type="URL" data-id="https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/paidsubscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify also did a similar thing in 2021, by adding subscriptions via their Anchor platform.</a> So once again, they see the value in it. It looks like Spotify isn't taking a cut right now, but they might add features that do in the future.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A similar example of a streaming platform adding membership tools is YouTube. They added memberships/contributions in the Partner Program where creators can make private videos and posts for those that contribute.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Like I said, I think it's inevitable they will try this. There's just too much money on the table and we see that they're clearly interested in getting in on the business model.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Do I think it will replace Patreon? Probably not. Naturally, you have fans on many different platforms and having to manage a community on Spotify AND Apple Music would get frustrating to manage. Plus if the platforms have any social component, it will mean dividing the social community.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I have no idea <em>how</em> it will play out, I just think it's bound to happen sooner than later.</p>
<p>

<p>You may have heard of a radio remix or a radio edit.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I used to work in radio programming and VERY often we would play a radio-specific version of the song. This is because either a) radio wanted something stylistically different than the album version or b) the song would only get identified as a single after the album was long done and needed more production than it got during the album-production process.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Radio programmers are NOTORIOUSLY picky – and often quite conservative with which songs they will add. And no, it's not because "radio hates anything unique." Ok maybe they do a liiiiiittle bit, but there's a REASON for it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You have to remember that the worst thing for a radio station is that a listener in their demographic could change the channel. If the listener jumps to a different preset, you may not see them back for DAYS. Repeat this too many times and the listener starts to favor the other station. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This means that a song you are playing has the potential to hurt you WAY MORE than the song you AREN'T playing. Listeners rarely think "man, why aren't they playing this other song," they're only thinking about the song they're hearing and if they like it or not. So good stations know they have to be very confident that the song will do well before they add it. My old boss would sometimes wait 6 months after the impact date just to see how it would test at other stations first.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other concern stations have is about keeping things moving. They want it to feel energetic yet have some dynamic to the flow. That means getting to the point, then moving on. They're not going to play songs that have 32-measure instrumental sections or repeat a bridge 8 times (if you're into worship music, go look up the radio edits of the songs and you'll see how they chop down all the bridges lol).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found a part of keeping things moving is even needing some sections beefed up compared to an album version of the song. We would regularly play songs that one of the main differences between the single and the album was that they had more percussion sooner and the song's builds would all get pushed forward a little. That's not to say radio WON'T play a soft song, but it still needs to have some oomph to it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other thing about making a dedicated radio version of the song is that you need all the help you can get to compete with the other songs also going for adds. Many stations only have 20-30 "current" slots. If you can make some tweaks to make it fit the format a little more, the better.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On the subject of formats, it's also important to remember that stations have to have formats to survive. They have to pick a target demographic and specific genre and stick to it in order to retain listeners. <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/davids-hierarchy-of-leads/" data-type="post" data-id="32613">They're also in the business of building true fans and superfans</a>.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here's a version of a song we produced for Anthem Worship. The first version is the one you'll hear on the album, and the second is the radio remix we did. You'll here that because the song is so dynamic, we had to figure out how to give the first verse and chorus a little more oomph while still retaining the build of the song. The other thing we did was give the song an intro that announcers could talk over (or room for a station liner). It's a tough balance because you also don't want a long, drawn out intro either.</p>

<h2 id="2-content-creator-artists-will-thrive">2. Content-Creator Artists Will Thrive</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A lot of the predictions I'm making here today are kinda related to this. I think musicians who create media beyond just music will have a great year. People want to build a parasocial relationship with you. If you're showing up not just in their music app, but also on their feeds, on YouTube, etc, they will be way more invested in you. Creating content – both short and long – is one of the few ways to level up people into true fans and superfans.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="3-artists-that-embrace-business-and-pr-skills-will-thrive">3. Artists that Embrace Business and PR Skills Will Thrive</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most artists overlook basic business skills. Being able to write copy is huge. As a content creator (even if you ONLY create music and none of the extra stuff), you're running a business and need to effectively communicate, inspire, and get people to take action. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And not just with fans, but with people in the business. You gotta be able to show you mean business to others like curators, bloggers, radio programmers, mangers, booking people, etc.</p>
<p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="4-ai-generated-personalized-playlists-will-be-more-valuable-than-large-editorial-playlists">4. AI-Generated, Personalized Playlists Will be More Valuable than Large Editorial Playlists</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We've seen things going this direction for a while. I think it will continue in this direction through 2023. Sure, getting on big playlists is great (and I'm not saying you shouldn't promote to playlists), but the long-term goal should be getting your music to become evergreen.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you can train the algorithms to who your fans are, you will be recommended in radio, "daily mixes," etc FOREVER.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Plus, I'd wager that people listen to their personalized/generated playlists more often than the editorial ones.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="5-consistency-in-releases-will-be-king">5. Consistency in Releases Will be King</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've talked about why singles are probably the right move for you. But let's talk about why singles are powerful: consistency.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First, people's listening habits have changed. If you're not being consistent, people are going to stop being as invested in what you're doing. Having new music come out on a schedule keeps people invested. Plus you actually have something newsworthy to share on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Secondly, the more prolific you are, the better you will train the Spotify and Apple Music algorithms. You can get a big batch of listeners heading over to your profile once a month.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="6-the-mega-single-will-be-a-new-trend">6. The "Mega Single" Will be a New Trend</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because people are more invested in SONGS than albums these days, I think artists will realize that people want to get more deeply invested in that song. So capitalize on the moment of when people care. If you release an acoustic version/video, behind the scenes content, story behind the song, alongside or shortly after, that gives the people who want to go deeper a chance to do so.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm predicting some people will even drop a "single" on the streaming platforms with up to three-five versions from day one: the standard one, the acoustic version, a remix, and maybe a live recording. It depends on your brand and style. Basically a mini-EP for the song.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="7-artists-who-put-all-their-stock-into-social-platforms-will-get-burned">7. Artists Who Put All Their Stock into Social Platforms Will Get Burned</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I have a gut feeling that a lot of people are gonna get burned by social media this year. Meta will do something to the IG algorithm, TikTok might get in legal trouble, etc. I'm not exactly sure what, but I have a feeling there will be SOMETHING that makes people frustrated that they can't reach their fans anymore.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Case in point on why you're just renting attention from those platforms: how a lot of users left Twitter after Musk took over. I'm not necessarily predicting the death of Twitter, but it's a great example of why you should be cautious about trusting platforms to be around forever.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Start diversifying your connection to fans now -- multiple platforms, an email list you own, etc.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2 id="8-artists-will-embrace-direct-support-from-fans-even-more">8. Artists Will Embrace Direct Support from Fans Even More</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>2023 will be a continuation of the trend we've seen the past few years. I think we'll see artists get even more savvy about how they get fans to support them. Thriving artists will level up their offerings, their communication for getting people invested and willing to support. It will just generally be more normal and accepted to ask for direct support.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="9-major-label-artists-will-embrace-elements-of-the-independent-business-model">9. Major-Label Artists Will Embrace Elements of the Independent Business Model</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think 2023 is the year that we'll see the big names embrace things like memberships, bonus content, etc. It's simply easy money for them.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<h2 id="10-groups-of-artists-will-create-networks-or-organizations-for-cross-promotion-cross-monetization">10. Groups of Artists Will Create Networks or Organizations for Cross-Promotion/Cross-Monetization</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the interesting things I've seen in the video game streaming world is the concept of organizations. It's not really a <em>team</em> per se, but a network/group of creators that cross promote, do events, and share in some of the overhead of managing sponsorships, etc.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's pretty common for artists to have their friends that they regularly collaborate and do shows with, but I think we might see this taken to another level this year. Something more than a loose friendship where you do stuff together, but something a little less than starting a label. More of a strategic alliance of independent creators. Not sure exactly what it will look like, but I think something like that will become more common this year.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="11-diy-shows-will-become-more-of-a-thing">11. DIY Shows Will Become More of a Thing</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think artists (and artist networks) will get better at taking the initiative of putting together shows themselves. Even if it's working with your local city to throw a block party, putting together a show in someone's backyard that's a little step up from a typical house show.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Basically what I'm getting at is that artists who want opportunities will have to make them themselves and get creative on making them happen, <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/successful-artists-make-their-own-opportunities/" data-type="post" data-id="28896">just like my friends, Bad Bad Hats.</a></p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You know how fashion influencers take sponsorship in exchange for posting about a product? I think we'll see more of that in 2023 but with indie artists. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Brands realize that normal people trust "microinfluencers" more than the massive accounts. It feels more like your friend is sharing about it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I know my friends <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/how-this-band-got-double-their-album-crowdfunding-goal-from-35k-to-65k/" data-type="post" data-id="30692">The Talbott Brothers</a> have partnered with brands like Buckle and Pinhook Bourbon before. And it works because their personal style is very comparable with Buckle, and their fans know they are big fans of bourbon.</p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Streaming platforms exist to make money. That means a) keeping people from switching platforms and b) extracting money from users.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Imagine Spotify launches their own membership platform that's managed from Spotify for Artists and they take 5% of all the proceeds. That's money for them and keeps you and your fans locked in to the platform.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We saw something similar happen with <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/878-subscriptions" data-type="URL" data-id="https://podcasters.apple.com/878-subscriptions">Apple adding memberships to their podcasting platform</a> a while back, and I don't know why they WOULDN'T do the same with Apple Music.</p>

<p>This is probably wishful thinking on my part, but I think the bubble will die out except in niche cases. It's really not that big of a thing for people outside of the enthusiast circles. People listen in their car, on smart speakers, or just on their laptop. People who write the checks to make the projects happen will realize it's not worth the extra cost.</p>
