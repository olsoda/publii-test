But in reality, touring is still one of the best ways to build a dedicated fanbase and establish a lasting connection with your audience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There's nothing quite like seeing an artist perform live. It's an immersive, intimate experience that allows fans to connect with the music and the artist on a deeper level. When you tour, you have the opportunity to interact with your fans in-person, create memorable experiences, and build a personal relationship with them. In fact, I think that's why even small gigs can lead to deeper relationships than large ones â€“ it's easy to just chill with the audience after the set and eat/drink. This makes people far more invested in you than just seeing you on a screen while doomscrolling.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Touring also allows you to expand your fanbase beyond your local area. It's a chance to play in front of new people and introduce yourself to people who may not have heard of you before. There's a reason people in every industry still get on a plane and meet face-to-face as opposed to just on the phone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, touring can also help you hone your craft as a performer. Playing live shows on a regular basis will help you improve your stage presence, crowd engagement, and overall performance skills. 10,000 hours and all that. Being on stage has to become more natural than being in an audience. You can always tell the difference between an experienced performer and one that's still finding their feet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So don't discount the power of touring - it's still an essential part of building a successful music career. Whether you're just starting out or you're an established artist, hitting the road is a great way to connect with your fans and grow your audience.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/david-ryan-olson/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> David Ryan Olson</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/what-is-music-production/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> What is Music Production? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-03-14T17:34" class="feed__date">March 14, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/which-sample-rate-is-best-to-record-at/">Which Sample Rate is Best to Record At?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-02-14T19:53" class="feed__date">February 14, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/best-home-recording-gear-for-most-musicians-in-2023/">Best Home Recording Gear for Most Musicians in 2023</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-02-14T12:17" class="feed__date">February 14, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/how-to-build-a-lasting-career-in-music-in-2023/">How To Build A Lasting Career In Music In 2023</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
