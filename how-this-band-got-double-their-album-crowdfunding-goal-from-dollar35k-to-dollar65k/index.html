Having a real budget helps the final product turn out better after all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But running a successful album crowdfunding campaign is easier said than done. Without planning, you probably wont reach your goal.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-talbott-brothers-new-album#/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-talbott-brothers-new-album#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">My friends The Talbott Brothers wrapped up their Indiegogo for their new album earlier this year. Not only did they meet their goal (which is always awesome), they almost DOUBLED their goal!!</a> Originally asking for $35,000, they ended with $65,165 â€“ which is incredible for an independent artist.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So how did they not just meet their goal, but OBLITERATE it? From what I can tell, it came down to a handful of things:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>They took time to plan the details of the album. Figured out what they wanted to do creatively, built a detailed budget, etc. This helps with the public ask. The fans knew what they'd be helping with. (Kinda like how your parents won't just write you check for no reason, but they might help you buy a new car or whatever).</li><li>They took the time to plan the album crowdfunding campaign itself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFBWvBxyNBA" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFBWvBxyNBA" rel="noreferrer noopener">They created a legit promo video for the Indiegogo</a>, came up with a variety of tiers (<a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/focus-on-growing-fans-not-your-stream-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="post" data-id="29997">since not all fans are created equal</a>), wrote compelling copy that detailed what they were planning on/why they wanted your help, were consistent in their promotion to their fans via email and social, etc.</li><li>Most importantly, they spent the past 10ish years developing DEEP one-on-one relationships with their fans. They are the poster children of <a href="https://evergreenrecords.com/blog/focus-on-growing-fans-not-your-stream-numbers/" data-type="post" data-id="29997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going deep not wide</a>. They crushed their goal with 14k Instagram followers while bands with two or three times the social following sometimes struggle to meet their goals.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to hear more about how they did it, we had them on a recent episode of Music Business Mindset to talk about album crowdfunding and more. It's a fantastic interview and highly recommended if you are ever interested in doing crowdfunding.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/music-business-mindset/id1499427688?i=1000533076573" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/music-business-mindset/id1499427688?i=1000533076573" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Listen on Apple Podcasts</strong></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BEeXd1c7CS4VXmC8U9cYI?si=ef516947670143f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Listen on Spotify</strong></a></p><p></p><p></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/28-how-the-talbott-bros-raised-2x-their-indiegogo-goal/id1499427688?i=1000540785074"></iframe></div><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/authors/david-ryan-olson/" rel="author">David Ryan Olson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/3-reasons-every-new-song-needs-a-lyric-video/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 3 Reasons Every New Song Needs A Lyric Video</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/guide-the-best-way-to-promote-your-single-in-2023-for-lasting-growth/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Guide: The Best Way to Promote Your Single in 2023 for Lasting Growth </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-06T18:07" class="feed__date">April 6, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/why-you-should-be-playing-shows-even-if-you-dont-have-a-band-yet/">Why You Should Be Playing Shows Even if You Don&#x27;t Have a Band Yet</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-10-04T00:15" class="feed__date">October 4, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://olsoda.github.io/publii-test/does-my-band-need-a-website-in-2023-6-reasons-why-you-still-do/">Does My Band Need A Website in 2023?
