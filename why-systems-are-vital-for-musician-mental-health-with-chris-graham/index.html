One of the most important ways to manage your mental health as a creative is to set yourself up for success using systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What does "systems" mean? It just means spending time working ON your business rather than FOR it. Alternatively, time spent to make the day-to-day stuff work better with less effort. Building a standard way of doing things frees up your mental bandwidth to focus on more important things – like songwriting, recording, networking, etc (although those things can also be systematized to a degree). Because of this, systems help with burnout – something creatives can fall into easily.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wanted to bring in an expert to talk about building systems in creative businesses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chris Graham is a musician turned mastering engineer turned business coach turned activist. You may know him from the 6 Figure Creative Podcast.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On this episode of Music Business Mindset,&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;shares his story, his journey with PTSD and mental health, and how that's taught him to build a business and life that works for you.
